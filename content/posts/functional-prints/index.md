"What do you make besides toys?"

"Don't you just throw most of the stuff away?"

Questions like these pop up a lot when somebody is thinking about getting into the 3D printing hobby. Well I can help justify picking it up!

I do, of course, end up printing toys, figures, and stuff for fun (including the door stopper in the post title). But I have found 3D printing great for little things around the house as well. Need adapters? Did a small piece break that renders a gadget useless? Well, your handy printer is there to help you out!

Below is a short gallery of some functional prints I have done. I will make more posts on the topic as time goes on...
