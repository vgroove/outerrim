## Me Complaining

Just skip this part, it's just me venting.

I used to enjoy self-hosting services because I enjoyed tinkering and didn't mind spending countless hours getting my various config files *juuuuust* right. Nowadays, I self-host because otherwise I don't have control over my data. For me, personally, it's not so much a privacy concern (my personal e-mails aren't that interesting). It's more about how most of Big Tech can just decide to change their services, their UI, and pretty much anything else without users having any say.

Here's a few examples off the top of my head:
	- Microsoft has decided Windows now has ads in the taskbar, they won't stop bothering me about OneDrive, and during their auto-updates they decided it's fine to reinstall software I purposefully uninstalled (how did TikTok get back on here?!).
	- Google Play Music was great, so great they decided to strip the best features like library curation and custom uploads in favor of a weird YouTube hybrid that for some reason has decided I would like to mash my YouTube video suggestions with music playlists.
	- Apparently Google engineers get promoted based upon how many poor UI changes they force on users per quarter. There have been a lot of promotions the past few years.

It seems a lot of these decisions are made to benefit only Big Tech, not users. They serve to:
	- Keep you in their ecosystem, so you can use more of their stuff.
	- Keep your attention on your devices, so you can look at more of their stuff.
	- Make it feel like things are moving forward, but really they're just thrashing, not doing anything of use at all. Probably just giving projects to their overpaid engineers so they don't move from Big Tech A to Big Tech B. Also keep looking at their stuff.

## Me Doing Something About It

I don't have as much free time to tinker anymore, but I want to self-host as much as I can so that I have some modicum of control. So, I have a 4 goals:
	- Self-host and automate as many digital services as I can that don't take a huge amount of manual effort to maintain.
	- Pay a reputable company a reasonable amount of money for the things I can't self-host, either because there's no alternatives or because the effort is too high.
	- Make sure all data is backed up regularly both on and off location. Make sure those backups actually work.
	- Make sure all of this is actually useful to my family and not just a stupid project for me and my self-righteous feelings.
